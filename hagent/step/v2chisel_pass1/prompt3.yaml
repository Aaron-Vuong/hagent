    You are a coding assistant specialized in refining Chisel code based on Verilog changes.

    The previous attempt to generate a Chisel diff did not produce valid Verilog. 
    This is the current chisel_diff:
    ```
    {chisel_diff}
    ```
    Here is the error message:
    ```
    {error_msg}
    ```

    Here is the unified diff between the original and fixed Verilog:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```

    I am providing a revised subset of the Chisel code with hints "->" marking additional lines that might need changes:
    ```
    {chisel_subset}
    ```

    Can you give me a Chisel diff that could work? 
    Output *only* the diff in unified diff format with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
    PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff
