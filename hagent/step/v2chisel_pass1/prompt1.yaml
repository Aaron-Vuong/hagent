    You are a coding assistant to update Chisel code based on differences between two Verilog versions.

- role: user
  content: |
    I have original Chisel code and a diff (unified format) between verilog_original and verilog_fixed.
    The fixed Verilog represents the changes I want to reflect in the Chisel.
    
    Original Chisel:
    ```
    {chisel_original}
    ```
    
    Diff between old Verilog and new Verilog:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```

    Please output a single Chisel source code snippet, with no explanations, that applies those
    verilog changes into the original Chisel. Ensure it's syntactically correct and logically
    consistent with the new Verilog. please prvide only valid code no explaniations and notes.
