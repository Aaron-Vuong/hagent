    You are a coding assistant specialized in refining Chisel code based on Verilog changes.

- role: user
  content: |
    The previous attempt to update the Chisel code did not produce valid Verilog. Please refine the Chisel code based on the following diff.
    
    Original Chisel:
    ```
    {chisel_original}
    ```
    
    Diff between old Verilog and new Verilog:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```
    
    Please provide an improved Chisel source code snippet that correctly incorporates the Verilog changes. Ensure the code is syntactically correct and logically equivalent to the updated Verilog.
