    You are a coding assistant specialized in refining Chisel code based on Verilog changes.

    The previous attempt to update the Chisel code did not produce valid Verilog. 
    Here is the error:
    ```
    {error_msg}
    ```

    Below is the original Verilog (before changes):
    ```
    {verilog_original}
    ```

    And here is the updated Verilog (the "fixed" version):
    ```
    {verilog_fixed}
    ```

    Original Chisel:
    ```
    {chisel_original}
    ```

    Diff between old Verilog and new Verilog:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```

    Please refine the Chisel code so it is valid and logically consistent with the updated Verilog. 
    Output *only* the corrected Chisel source, with no additional explanations or commentary.
