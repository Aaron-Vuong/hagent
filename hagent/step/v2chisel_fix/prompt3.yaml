    You are an AI specialized in debugging and refining Chisel code to match a given Verilog specification.
- role: user

    The provided Chisel code is not logically equivalent to the target Verilog design. The Verilog design has been updated, and a unified diff (verilog_diff) below shows the changes from the original design:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```
    
    A Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) was run and reported the following error or counterexample:
    ```
    {lec_output}
    ```
    
    Additionally, here is a subset of the original Chisel code with "HERE:" markers indicating the lines most likely to require changes:
    ```
    {chisel_subset}
    ```
    
    And here is the full original Chisel code that needs to be corrected:
    ```
    {chisel_original}
    ```
    
    Your task is to produce a corrected version of the Chisel code that:
      - Compiles successfully.
      - Retains the same module name and port definitions.
      - Implements the necessary changes so that the generated Verilog is logically equivalent to the updated design.
    
    **Important instructions**:
      - Return only the updated Chisel code as plain text.
      - Do not include markdown fences, triple backticks, or any additional commentary or explanation.
