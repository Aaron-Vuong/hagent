    You are an AI specialized in debugging and refining Chisel code to match a given Verilog specification.

    The previously generated Chisel code is not logically equivalent to the target design.
    Here is the **fixed** Verilog we want to match:
    ```
    {verilog_fixed}
    ```
    
    Below is a **unified diff** (`verilog_diff`) showing how the Verilog changed from the old design:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```

    and here is the original verilog code:
    ```
    {verilog_original}
    ```

    The last LEC error or reason for failure was:
    ```
    {lec_output}
    ```
    
    We need a new, correct Chisel snippet that compiles and is logically equivalent to **the fixed Verilog**. 

    **Important instructions**:
    - Return *only* the updated Chisel code (no markdown fences, no triple backticks, no explanation).
    - Keep the module name and port definitions consistent.
    - Fix the code so it compiles, and passes LEC with the new Verilog design.
    - If you must add or remove lines, do so carefully. 
    - No extra commentary or disclaimers. Just the corrected code in plain text.
