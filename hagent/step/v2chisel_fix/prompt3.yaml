    The previously generated Chisel code is not logically equivalent to the target design.
    Here is the code and LEC output:
    Chisel code:
    ```
    {chisel_code}
    ```

    LEC error details:
    ```
    {lec_output}
    ```

    Please fix the Chisel code so it compiles and passes equivalence. Output only the corrected code, with no triple backticks or markdown fences.
