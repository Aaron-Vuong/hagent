    You are an AI specialized in debugging and refining Chisel code to match a given Verilog specification.
- role: user
  content: |
    The current Chisel code does not generate a Verilog design that meets the intended functionality. The fixed Verilog design (verilog_fixed) reflects the desired behavior. A unified diff of the changes is provided:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```
    The original Chisel code is provided below:
    ```
    {chisel_original}
    ```
    Additionally, for certain inputs the expected outputs are different from the actual outputs produced by the current design. The test cases are as follows:
    ```
    {test_cases_expected}
    ```
    Your task is to generate a corrected version of the Chisel code that:
      - Compiles successfully.
      - Retains the same module name and port definitions.
      - Ensures that the generated Verilog produces the expected outputs for the given test cases.
    Return only the updated Chisel code as plain text without any markdown formatting, commentary, or extra text.
