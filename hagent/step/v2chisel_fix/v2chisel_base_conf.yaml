        The previous refinement attempt using prompt3 did not yield a satisfactory fix.
        The Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) reported the following error or counterexample:
        ```
        {lec_output}
        ```
        The Verilog diff between the fixed and candidate designs is as follows:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```
        The current Chisel diff between the original and the latest candidate code is as follows:
        ```
        {chisel_diff}
        ```
        Additionally, based on further code analysis, here are new hints extracted from the chisel_original with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
        ```
        {new_hints}
        ```
        Can you give me a Chisel diff that could work?
        Output *only* the diff in unified diff format with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
        PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff

        The provided Chisel code is not logically equivalent to the target Verilog design. The Verilog design has been updated, and a unified diff (verilog_diff) below shows the changes from the original design:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```

        A Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) was run and reported the following error or counterexample:
        ```
        {lec_output}
        ```

        I also provide a subset of the Chisel code with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
        ```
        {chisel_subset}
        ```

        The previous refinement attempts using prompt4 did not yield a satisfactory fix.
        Please generate Chisel diffs that could work. Consider the following:
        The Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) reported:
        ```
        {lec_output}
        ```
        The Verilog diff is:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```
        I also provide a subset of the Chisel code with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
        ```
        {chisel_subset}
        ```
        Please output *only* the diffs in unified diff format with only the minimal hunks containing the changed lines.
        No explanation, no commentary, only diffs.

        You are an AI specialized in debugging and refining Chisel code to fix compilation errors.
        The current Chisel code does not compile and the following compiler error was reported.

        The current Chisel code is:
        ```
        {current_chisel}

        and the compiler error is:
        ```
        {compiler_error}
        ```
        Please generate a minimal unified diff that fixes the compilation error so that the code can compile.
        Output *only* the diff with no extra commentary.
