        The previous refinement attempt using prompt3 did not yield a satisfactory fix.
        The Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) reported the following error or counterexample:
        ```
        {lec_output}
        ```
        The Verilog diff between the fixed and candidate designs is as follows:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```
        The current Chisel diff between the original and the latest candidate code is as follows:
        ```
        {chisel_diff}
        ```
        Additionally, based on further code analysis, here are new hints extracted from the chisel_original with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
        ```
        {new_hints}
        ```
        Can you give me a Chisel diff that could work?
        Output *only* the diff in unified diff format with only the minimal hunk containing the changed lines and no additional commentary or headers or Note.
        PLEASE No explanation, no Note. ONLY diff

        The provided Chisel code is not logically equivalent to the target Verilog design. The Verilog design has been updated, and a unified diff (verilog_diff) below shows the changes from the original design:
        ```
        {verilog_diff}
        ```

        A Logic Equivalence Check (LEC) was run and reported the following error or counterexample:
        ```
        {lec_output}
        ```

        I also provide a subset of the Chisel code with hints "->" marking the lines that are most likely to require changes:
        ```
        {chisel_subset}
        ```
