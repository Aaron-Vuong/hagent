    You are an AI specialized in debugging and refining Chisel code to match a given Verilog specification.
- role: user
  content: |
    The current Chisel code fails to generate a Verilog design that is fully equivalent to the updated reference design. The updated design (verilog_fixed) and a unified diff showing the changes are provided:
    ```
    {verilog_diff}
    ```
    The original Chisel code is provided below:
    ```
    {chisel_original}
    ```
    In addition, for a set of specific inputs, the actual outputs must remain the same as they currently are. The test cases showing these required behaviors are:
    ```
    {test_cases_same}
    ```
    Your task is to generate a corrected version of the Chisel code that:
      - Compiles successfully.
      - Retains the same module name and port definitions.
      - Produces a Verilog design that is logically equivalent to the updated reference design while preserving the output behavior for the specified test cases.
    Return only the updated Chisel code as plain text without any markdown formatting, commentary, or extra text.
